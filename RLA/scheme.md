# Robot Implementation Plan

## Overview
The goal is to build a simple robot that follows a path and transfers data from an SD card wirelessly to a PC as the first step of the LCO project The robot will use an **Arduino Nano** as its main controller and an **ESP-01** for wireless data transfer.

### Components
1. **Arduino Nano**: Main controller to handle sensors, motors, and data processing.
2. **ESP-01 (Wi-Fi Module)**: For wireless data transfer to a PC.
3. **Motor Driver Module (L298N)**: To control the robot's DC motors.
4. **Motors**: DC motors for movement.
5. **Power Supply**: A 7.4V Li-ion battery pack to power the robot.
6. **Line Following Sensors:QTR-8A ***: To detect and follow a path.
7. **SD Card Module**: For storing data to be transferred wirelessly.
9. **Voltage Regulator (LM2596)**: To provide 3.3V for the ESP-01.

## Components and Their Roles

### 1. **Arduino Nano**
   - Controls the motors and sensors.
   - Reads data from the SD card.
   - Sends data to the ESP-01 for wireless transfer.

### 2. **ESP-01 (Wi-Fi Module)**
   - Handles wireless communication between the robot and the PC.
   - Receives data from the Arduino Nano via UART.
   - Transfers data to the PC using Wi-Fi.

### 3. **Motor Driver (L298N)**
   - Controls two DC motors for the robot's movement.
   - Connects to the Arduino Nano's digital pins to control motor direction and speed.

### 4. **QTR-8A Reference Array Sensor**
   - Detect the path for the robot to follow (e.g., using infrared sensors to detect black/white lines).

### 5. **SD Card Module**
   - Stores log data or sensor information for later transfer to the PC.
   - Connects to the Arduino Nano via SPI interface.

### 6. **Power Supply**
   - A 7.4V Li-ion battery pack powers the Arduino Nano and motors.
   - A voltage regulator (LM2596) will step down the battery voltage to 3.3V for the ESP-01.

## System Workflow

1. **Robot Movement:**
   - The Arduino Nano reads data from the line-following sensors to control motor movements.
   - The motor driver controls the speed and direction of the motors.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Data transfered form a pc/ unit is stored on an SD card.

3. **Wireless Data Transfer:**
   - The Arduino Nano sends data from the SD card to the ESP-01 via serial communication (UART).
   - The ESP-01 transfers the data wirelessly to a PC using Wi-Fi (either through an HTTP server, FTP, or socket communication).

4. **Optional Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - If an ultrasonic sensor is included, the Arduino Nano can read the distance to obstacles and stop or change direction when an object is detected.

## Power Management
- **Arduino Nano:** Powered via VIN pin with 7.4V from the battery.
- **ESP-01:** Powered via a 3.3V regulator (LM2596).
- **Motors:** Powered directly from the 7.4V battery through the motor driver.

## Suggested Battery
- **7.4V Li-ion Battery Pack**: At least 2000mAh capacity.
- Use a **voltage regulator** (LM2596) to step down to 3.3V for the ESP-01.

## Additional Notes
- **Wireless Communication:** The ESP-01 can either serve a web page for data transfer or use simple socket communication to send data to a PC.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure the power supply is adequate for motors and sensors, as motors can draw significant current under load.
